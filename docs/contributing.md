Repository Structure

  1.The repository is organized by language. Each language has its own folder (e.g., C++, Java, Python), and contributors should place their programs in the correct folder based on the language.
  2.Within each language folder, use descriptive, consistent file names that reflect the functionality of the program (e.g., binary_search.cpp, quick_sort.py).

Duplicate File Guidelines

  1.Avoid Duplicates: Before submitting, check if a similar program already exists to prevent redundancy.
  2. Naming Conventions: Use consistent and descriptive file names to make programs easily identifiable.
  3.GitHub Actions: Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically checks for duplicate files on each pull request, helping maintain a clean structure.
